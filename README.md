# Flappy Arms

Flap your arms to fly a bird through a cartoon kitchen. Built for StormHacks 2026.

## Run locally

Use Node.js 22.12 or newer.

```sh
npm ci
npm run dev
```

Open the local URL printed by Vite. The game uses a 1280 by 720 canvas that fits the browser while preserving its aspect ratio.

```sh
npm run typecheck
npm run build
npm run preview
```

## Team integration

`src/input/types.ts` defines the shared `InputState` and `InputSource` contract. Input producers register with `inputManager.setSource(source)`. Gameplay reads `inputManager.getState()` every frame without waiting on the camera or network.

| Folder | Owner / purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `src/input` | Shared contract and input sources |
| `src/cv` | Camera integration seam |
| `src/game/scenes` | Phaser scenes, Dev 2 |
| `src/audio` | Voice and sound, Dev 3 |
| `src/net` | Backend connection, Dev 3 |
| `public/assets` | Art and audio from the designer |

## Review workflow

One branch and pull request per ticket. Use commit titles such as `feat(FA-1): scaffold the Phaser frontend`. Describe the behavior, validation, and dependencies in each PR. Merge through `dev` after team review.
